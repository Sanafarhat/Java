1) When  are  10  and  20  substituted  for   'a'  and  'b' ?  ---> At  compile  time

2) What  is  the  issue  with  System . out . println("Bye")  ?  --->
															It  is  not  compiled  due  to  infinite  loop  and  hence  compiler  throws  error

3) Is  the  program  compiled  without  System . out . println("Bye") ?  --->  Yes

4) What  are  the  outputs  without  System . out . println("Bye") --->  Hello  infinite  times
